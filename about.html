    <h2>Luka Dončić</h2>
    <p>
      I like Luka because he is a shooting guard/point guard that is often
      compared to Stephen Curry, the point guard on the Los Angeles Lakers. He
      has won several awards for his competence within the NBA and is overall a
      really good player in my opinion. Luka Dončić currently plays for the
      Dallas Mavericks alongside several other superstars.

    <h2>Ja Morant</h2>
    <p>
      I like Ja because he is also a point guard but he contradicts his height
      and dunks on people way taller than him. A prime example of this
      contradition would be when he dunked on the famous center Jalen Smith. Ja
      Morant is only 6 foot 2 while Jalen Smith is an astonishing 6 foot 7. Ja
      is an overall good player and brings alot of energy to his team. Ja Morant
      currently plays for the Memphis Grizzlies.

    <h2>Memphis Grizzlies</h2>
    <p>
      My favourite team is the Memphis Grizzlies. Many of the most famous NBA
      players play on this team. Many of them include: Ja Morant, Steven Adams,
      Ziare Williams and many more.
